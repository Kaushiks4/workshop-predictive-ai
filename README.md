## <a name="step-1"></a>Log into Confluent Cloud

1. Log into [Confluent Cloud](https://confluent.cloud) and enter your email and password.

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/login.png" width=50% height=50%>
</div>

2. If you are logging in for the first time, you will see a self-guided wizard that walks you through spinning up a cluster. Please minimize this as you will walk through those steps in this workshop. 

***

## <a name="step-2"></a>Create an Environment and Cluster

An environment contains clusters and its deployed components such as Apache Flink, Connectors, ksqlDB, and Schema Registry. You have the ability to create different environments based on your company's requirements. For example, you can use environments to separate Development/Testing, Pre-Production, and Production clusters. 

1. Click **+ Add Environment**. Specify an **Environment Name** and Click **Create**. 

>**Note:** There is a *default* environment ready in your account upon account creation. You can use this *default* environment for the purpose of this workshop if you do not wish to create an additional environment.

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/environment.png" width=50% height=50%>
</div>

2. Now that you have an environment, click **Create Cluster**. 

> **Note:** Confluent Cloud clusters are available in 3 types: Basic, Standard, and Dedicated. Basic is intended for development use cases so you will use that for the workshop. Basic clusters only support single zone availability. Standard and Dedicated clusters are intended for production use and support Multi-zone deployments. If you are interested in learning more about the different types of clusters and their associated features and limits, refer to this [documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/clusters/cluster-types.html).

3. Chose the **Basic** cluster type. 

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/cluster-type.png" width=50% height=50%>
</div>

4. Click **Begin Configuration**. 
5. Choose your preferred Cloud Provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure), region, and availability zone. 
6. Specify a **Cluster Name**. For the purpose of this lab, any name will work here. 

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/create-cluster.png" width=50% height=50%>
</div>

7. View the associated *Configuration & Cost*, *Usage Limits*, and *Uptime SLA* information before launching. 
8. Click **Launch Cluster**. 

***

## <a name="step-3"></a>Create a Flink Compute Pool

1. On the navigation menu, select **Flink** and click **Create Compute Pool**.

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/create-flink-pool-1.png" width=50% height=50%>
</div>

2. Select **Region** and then **Continue**.
<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/create-flink-pool-2.png" width=50% height=50%>
</div>

3. Name you Pool Name and set the capacity units (CFUs) to **5**. Click **Finish**.

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/create-flink-pool-3.png" width=50% height=50%>
</div>

> **Note:** The capacity of a compute pool is measured in CFUs. Compute pools expand and shrink automatically based on the resources required by the statements using them. A compute pool without any running statements scale down to zero. The maximum size of a compute pool is configured during creation. 

4. Flink Compute pools will be ready shortly. You can click **Open SQL workspace** when the pool is ready to use.

5. Change your workspace name by clicking **settings button**. Click **Save changes** after you update the workspace name.

***

## <a name="step-4"></a>Creates Topic and Walk Through Cloud Dashboard

1. On the navigation menu, you will see **Cluster Overview**. 

> **Note:** This section shows Cluster Metrics, such as Throughput and Storage. This page also shows the number of Topics, Partitions, Connectors, and ksqlDB Applications.

2. Click on **Cluster Settings**. This is where you can find your *Cluster ID, Bootstrap Server, Cloud Details, Cluster Type,* and *Capacity Limits*.
3. On the same navigation menu, select **Topics** and click **Create Topic**. 
4. Enter **customers** as the topic name, **3** as the number of partitions, and then click **Create with defaults**.'

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/create-topic.png" width=50% height=50%>
</div>

5. Repeat the previous step and create a second topic name **credit_cards** and **3** as the number of partitions.
   
6. Repeat the previous step and create a second topic name **transactions** and **3** as the number of partitions.

> **Note:** Topics have many configurable parameters. A complete list of those configurations for Confluent Cloud can be found [here](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/using/broker-config.html). If you are interested in viewing the default configurations, you can view them in the Topic Summary on the right side. 

7. After topic creation, the **Topics UI** allows you to monitor production and consumption throughput metrics and the configuration parameters for your topics. When you begin sending messages to Confluent Cloud, you will be able to view those messages and message schemas.

***

## <a name="step-5"></a>Create Datagen Connectors for Customers and Credit Cards
The next step is to produce sample data using the Datagen Source connector. You will create two Datagen Source connectors. One connector will send sample customer data to **customers** topic, the other connector will send sample credit card data to **credit_cards** topic.

1. First, you will create the connector that will send data to **customers**. From the Confluent Cloud UI, click on the **Connectors** tab on the navigation menu. Click on the **Datagen Source** icon.

          "range": {
            "min": 1000,
            "max": 1500
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
7. Click on **Continue**, Sizing should be good, click on **Continue** again. You can name the connector anything or leave it as default and click on **Continue**.

</div>


8. After few seconds Connector would be provisioned and running. Check for messages in the **customers** topic by navigating to the topics section.
9. Repeat the same steps to create a connector for **credit_cards** topic by using the below schema but use existing API key this time.
```
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "CreditCards",
  "namespace": "workshop_5",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "credit_card_number",
      "type": {
        "type": "long",
        "arg.properties": {
          "iteration": {
            "start": 4738273984732749,
            "step": 749384739937
          }
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "customer_id",
      "type": {
        "type": "int",
        "arg.properties": {
          "iteration": {
            "start": 100
          }

</div>

> **Note:** If the connectors fails, there are a few different ways to troubleshoot the error:
> * Click on the *Connector Name*. You will see a play and pause button on this page. Click on the play button.
> * Click on the *Connector Name*, go to *Settings*, and re-enter your API key and secret. Double check there are no extra spaces at the beginning or end of the key and secret that you may have accidentally copied and pasted.
> * If neither of these steps work, try creating another Datagen connector.


11. You can view the sample data flowing into topics in real time. Navigate to  the **Topics** tab and then click on the **customers** and **credit_cards**. You can view the production and consumption throughput metrics here.

12. Click on **Messages**.

* You should now be able to see the messages within the UI. You can view the specific messages by clicking the icon.
***
## <a name="step-6"></a>Create a Producer for transactions topic
The next step is to produce sample data using a client. You will configure a python client for **transactions** topic.

1. From the Confluent Cloud UI, click on the **Clients** tab on the navigation menu. Click on the **Add new client** button on the top right.
<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/producer-1.png" width=75% height=75%>
</div>

2. Choose **Python** in choose your language option.
<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/producer-2.png" width=75% height=75%>
</div>

3. Click on  **Use existing API Key** in select an API key and fill out the downloaded API keys.
<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/producer-3.png" width=75% height=75%>
</div>

4. Click on  **Use existing topic** in type **transactions**.
5. Copy the configuration snippet shown in the screen for next setup.
<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/producer-4.png" width=75% height=75%>
</div>

## <a name="step-7"></a>Clone the repository and configure the clients.
The next step is to run the producer to produce 100 transactions to the **transactions** topic.

1. Open VS Code or any editor of your choice.
2. Clone the github repo to your local system inside the folder of your choice.
```
git clone https://github.com/Kaushiks4/workshop-predictive-ai.git
cd workshop-predictive-ai
```

3. Create a virtual environment for this project and activate it by running the following command
```
python3 -m venv _venv
source _venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install the dependencies by running the following commmand.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the ```transaction_producer.py``` file by running the following command.
```
python3 transaction_producer.py
```
If the program is complete successfully you can see the following message in your terminal.
```
INFO:root:Generated 100 transactions complete.
```
> **Note:** If the producer fails, there are a few different ways to troubleshoot the error:
> * Click on the *Cluster Overiview*, go to *Cluster Settings*,. Double check there are no extra spaces at the beginning or end of the key and secret that you may have accidentally copied and pasted in ```client.properties``` file also verify the ```bootstrap.servers``` value by comparing it with the *Bootstrap Server* value in the Endpoints section in UI.

## <a name="step-8"></a>Add data contract to transactions topic
Since we used a client to produce the records to the **transactions** topic, we should add data contract for the topic explicitly.

1. From the Confluent Cloud UI, click on the **Topics** tab on the navigation menu. Click on the **transactions** topic.
<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/data-contract-1.png" width=75% height=75%>
</div>

2. Click on *Data Contracts* in the menu pane and click on **Add data contract**.
<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/data-contract-2.png" width=75% height=75%>
</div>

3. Choose *JSON Schema* from the type available.
<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/data-contract-3.png" width=75% height=75%>
</div>

4. Paste the following schema inside the available block.
```
{
    "properties": {
      "amount": {
        "connect.index": 3,
        "connect.type": "int32",
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "credit_card_number": {
        "connect.index": 2,
        "connect.type": "int64",
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "location": {
        "connect.index": 4,
        "type": "string"
      },
      "transaction_id": {
        "connect.index": 0,
        "connect.type": "int32",
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "transaction_timestamp": {
        "connect.index": 1,
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "title": "TransactionRecord",
    "type": "object"
}
```
5. Click on **Create**.
<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="images/data-contract-4.png" width=75% height=75%>
</div>

## <a name="step-9"></a>Perform complex joins using Flink to combine the records into one topic
Kafka topics and schemas are always in sync with our Flink cluster. Any topic created in Kafka is visible directly as a table in Flink, and any table created in Flink is visible as a topic in Kafka. Effectively, Flink provides a SQL interface on top of Confluent Cloud.

1. From the Confluent Cloud UI, click on the **Environments** tab on the navigation menu. Choose your environment.
2. Click on *Flink* from the menu pane
3. Choose the compute pool created in the previous steps.
4. Click on **Open SQL workspace** button on the top right.
5. Create an **aggregated_transactions** table by running the following SQL query.
```sql
CREATE TABLE aggregated_transactions (
    transaction_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY NOT ENFORCED,
    credit_card_number BIGINT,
    customer_email STRING,
    total_amount INT,
    average_spending_amount INT,
    transaction_timestamp TIMESTAMP(3),
    WATERMARK FOR transaction_timestamp AS transaction_timestamp - INTERVAL '1' SECOND
) WITH (
    'changelog.mode' = 'upsert'
);
```

6. Add a new query by clicking on + icon in the left of previous query to Insert records to the above table by running the following query.
```sql
INSERT INTO aggregated_transactions
SELECT 
    t.transaction_id,
    t.credit_card_number,
    cust.customer_email,
    t.amount,
    cust.average_spending_amount,
    TO_TIMESTAMP(t.transaction_timestamp) AS transaction_timestamp
FROM transactions t
INNER JOIN credit_cards cc ON t.credit_card_number = cc.credit_card_number
INNER JOIN customers cust ON cc.customer_id = cust.customer_id
```
7. Now we will create a ```feature_set`` topic to put all the transactions in specific windows. To perform the same run the following query.
```sql
CREATE TABLE feature_set (
    credit_card_number BIGINT PRIMARY KEY NOT ENFORCED,
    customer_email STRING,
    total_amount INT,
    transaction_count BIGINT,
    average_spending_amount INT,
    window_start TIMESTAMP(3),
    window_end TIMESTAMP(3)
) WITH (
  'changelog.mode' = 'upsert',
  'value.format' = 'json-registry',
  'key.format' = 'json-registry'
)
```
```sql
INSERT INTO feature_set
  WITH windowed_transactions AS (
SELECT 
    credit_card_number,
    SUM(total_amount) AS total_amount,
    COUNT(transaction_id) AS transaction_count,
    window_start,
    window_end
FROM 
  TABLE(
    TUMBLE(TABLE aggregated_transactions, DESCRIPTOR(transaction_timestamp),INTERVAL '10' MINUTES)
  )
GROUP BY credit_card_number, window_start,window_end
)
SELECT DISTINCT
  t.credit_card_number,
  t.customer_email,
  wt.total_amount,
  wt.transaction_count,
  t.average_spending_amount,
  wt.window_start,
  wt.window_end
 FROM 
  aggregated_transactions t
 JOIN
   windowed_transactions wt
 ON
  wt.credit_card_number = t.credit_card_number
 AND
  t.transaction_timestamp BETWEEN wt.window_start AND wt.window_end
```

Windows are central to processing infinite streams. Windows split the stream into “buckets” of finite size, over which you can apply computations. This document focuses on how windowing is performed in Confluent Cloud for Apache Flink and how you can benefit from windowed functions.

Flink provides several window table-valued functions (TVF) to divide the elements of your table into windows, including:

a. [Tumble Windows](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/reference/queries/window-tvf.html#flink-sql-window-tvfs-tumble)
<br> 
b. [Hop Windows](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/reference/queries/window-tvf.html#flink-sql-window-tvfs-hop)
<br> 
c. [Cumulate Windows](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/reference/queries/window-tvf.html#flink-sql-window-tvfs-cumulate)
<br> 

## <a name="step-10"></a>Consume feature set topic and predict fraud transactions
The next step is to create a consumer for feature set topic and predict the fraudulent transaction.

1. First, you will have to create a **fraudulent_transactions** topic by following the steps detailed in (#step-4). Use 3 partitions.
2. Once the topic gets created, click on *Data Contract* and **Add a data contract**.
3. Choose *JSON Schema* as type and paste the following conten and click on **Create**.
```json
{
    "title": "FraudulentTransactionsRecord",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "details": {
        "connect.index": 0,
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
}
```
3. Update ```client.properties``` file with an additional configuration at the end of the file like following.
```bash
group.id=Workshop5<6 random chars>
```

4. Run the ```fraud_detector.py``` to determine the fraudulent transactions from the feature set and produce the transactions to the topic created above.
```python
python3 fraud_detector.py
```

5. Now you can see few messages in the *fraudulent_transactions* topic.

> **Note:** This demonstration simulates a sample condition as a machine learning model to showcase the capabilities of real-time streaming with Confluent Cloud.
In this setup, a data engineer can extract the required features from various sources into separate topics. These topics enable data scientists to leverage the curated feature sets to develop and train machine learning models outside of the Confluent Cloud environment.
This illustrates the power of integrating Confluent Cloud for efficient data streaming and feature engineering in the ML workflow.

## <a name="step-11"></a>Connect Flink with Bedrock Model
The next step is to create a integrated model from AWS Bedrock with Flink on Confluent Cloud.

1. First, you will create the model connection using Confluent CLI. If you've never installed one, you could install it based on your OS (https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/install.html) and login to confluent.
```bash
confluent login
```

2. Make sure you prepare your AWS API Key and Secret to create connection to the Bedrock. (Would be provided in the workshop)

3. Make sure you are using the right environment and right cluster to create the connection. Verify by performing the following.
```bash
confluent environment list
confluent environment use <env-id>
confluent kafka cluster list
confluent kafka cluster use <cluster-id>
```

```bash
confluent flink connection create my-connection --cloud aws --region us-east-1 --type bedrock --endpoint https://bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/model/meta.llama3-8b-instruct-v1:0/invoke --aws-access-key <API Key> --aws-secret-key <API Secret>
```

3. After creating connection, we need to create the model in Flink before we could invoke on our query.
```sql
CREATE MODEL NotificationEngine
INPUT (details STRING)
OUTPUT (message STRING)
WITH (
  'task' = 'text_generation',
  'provider' = 'bedrock',
  'bedrock.connection' = 'my-connection',
);
```

5. Now let's invoke the model and get the results.

```sql
SELECT message FROM fraudulent_transactions, LATERAL TABLE(ML_PREDICT('NotificationEngine', details));
```
